# Delete old pull request artifacts (GitHub Action)

_GitHub Action to delete all workflow artifacts for a branch_

## Motivation

Artifacts generated by pull-requests can quickly use all the storage you paid for.
Usually, when the PR is merged or closed, artifacts belonging to that pull-request are no longer needed.
To delete them, use this GitHub Action.

## Usage

### When closing pull request

```yaml
name: PR cleanup

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [closed]

jobs:
  delete_pr_artifacts:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: stefanluptak/delete-old-pr-artifacts@v1
        with:
          workflow_filename: ci.yaml
```

### When synchronizing pull request

If you want to delete previous artifacts for active PR, just use event type `synchronize` instead of `closed`. Remember to call this action before building fresh new artifact to not delete it too.

## Parameters
